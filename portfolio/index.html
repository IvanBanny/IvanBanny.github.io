        I have a broad experience of coding. In my free time I like to set myself goals and do fun
         projects that I can show to others (some of them are on my <a href="https://github.com/IvanBanny">Github page</a>).
         I have a good knowledge of C++, Python, Html, Css and JavaScript.
         I also have experience of making applications using Electron
         <a href="https://github.com/IvanBanny/assignments-app">(link to Github)</a>, Visual Studio .NET and Unity.

        I am curious about AI and I like to put it into practical aplications.<br>
        Here are 2 of my projects:

    <p class="description2">
        • A pointer that follows face in x and y dimensions, using Arduino circuit board,
         2 servo motors, my laptop with camera and, of course, my programing skills in Python.<br><br>
        • A drone that follows face (I made my Tello drone follow faces using Python and djiTelloPy library)

    <p class="description1">Besides that, I frequently participate in Informatical contests.</p>

        I also have experience in Blender and various video editing software:
